Sports Analytics project:
Using Pitch F/X data to examine umpire biases.We explored the percentages of actual strikes called strikes, actual balls called strikes, actual balls called balls and actual balls called strikes by different counts. We used this information to determine if umpires were making incorrect calls unconciously in order to not make a terminal call (i.e. called strikeout or called walk on close pitches). There have been studyies that suggest referees are subject to this terminal bias.
We also explored if umpires make "make-up" calls if they miscall a pitch before another close pitch. Our analysis and discussion are available in the RMarkdown file.
